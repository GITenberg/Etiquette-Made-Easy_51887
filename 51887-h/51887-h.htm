<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="130" height="139" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">THE POLITEST MAN of
whom history has record
was a Norwegian. A stranger
in a town of Norway
asked a passing native the
way to a certain address. The native raised
his hat, bowed, and said:</p>

<p>“Sir, I am very sorry, but I do not
know.”</p>

<p>The stranger passed on. A few minutes
later, he heard the sound of some one running
behind him. He faced about, and
recognized the native, who came, halted,
and after a few deep breaths, said, while
bowing with uplifted hat:</p>

<p>“Sir, after leaving you, I met my brother-in-law,
and I regret to tell you, Sir, that he
also does not know.”</p>

<p>In spite of this story with its Norwegian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
hero, first place is usually given to the
French in matters of politeness. There is
an old story that illustrates with remarkable
precision the national traits of French,
English and German. This has to do with
the manner of lighting a cigar. The
Frenchman strikes a match, offers the flame
to his companions, then makes a light for
himself. The Englishman lights his own
cigar first, and then offers the match to
his companions. The German lights his
own cigar, then throws the match away.
The brief recital contains something deeper
than mere humor in its analysis of national
characteristics. The consideration of the
Frenchman for others is indeed the essential
basis for all true courtesy. Genuine
politeness has its root always in a very
real regard for the feelings of others.</p>

<p>The ancient proverb declares that cleanliness
is next to godliness. In fact, so far
as concerns casual associations, cleanliness
is the more important. We have ordinarily
nothing to do with the morals of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
whom we encounter for a few fugitive
moments, but the most fleeting companionship
with a dirty person is offensive, while a
perfect cleanliness is always pleasing in its
effect.</p>

<p>As a matter of fundamental courtesy
toward others, we are required to keep
ourselves clean. Such cleanliness may be
excellent as a hygienic measure, but one
most eminent physician has declared that
bathing is not essential to health, and he
offers in proof of his assertion the great
number of old persons there are in the
world.</p>

<p>But those aged unwashed would be
repulsive in refined society. Their condition
would distress others. Quite involuntarily,
they would thus be guilty of
discourtesy.</p>

<p>The principle of consideration for others
that exalts cleanliness as a virtue is the
principle that actually fashions all the
essential forms of politeness. At a decent
dinner-table, one must not smack his lips,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
or make loud noises in taking soup from
the spoon, for the simple reason that such
behavior will annoy others. Often, a sympathetic
person, absolutely untaught in the
niceties of etiquette, will do the right thing
by a natural instinct of kindliness, where
another individual of polite breeding will
do the wrong from sheer lack of that fellow-feeling
which gives understanding.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, while the noblest courtesy
must spring always from the heart,
common convenience has settled on definite
methods of deportment for various
occasions. Ignorance of these details as
to proper conduct is not a matter to be
contemned, but one to be regretted, because
a person thus ignorant, no matter
how kindly his intention, must often disturb
others by failure to do the expected
thing in the expected way. In other words,
he lacks knowledge of what are termed the
proprieties. It is with the intention of
offering assistance to those finding themselves
in doubt as to the niceties of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
deportment that this book has been prepared.</p>

<p>It is arranged with the contents in alphabetical
order, so that the topics are self-indexed.</p>

<p>In addition to the bulk of information
set forth in the following pages, there needs
only one direction of importance.</p>

<p>This is based on the ancient saying:
“When in Rome, do as the Romans do.”
Practically every community has its local
customs, and these are always to be respected.
There is nothing more snobbish
than criticism by a stranger of social forms
that are well established. It is always his
duty to respect them and to observe them.
Otherwise, he displays that lack of consideration
for others which is the root of
all rudeness. One sympathetically disposed
toward his fellows who avails himself
of the information in this book may
rest confident in the assurance that he is
indeed the possessor of good manners.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">THE AFTERNOON TEA is
perhaps the most popular of
social functions, and deservedly
so, since it is essentially
of the utmost simplicity, yet
may be expanded into a most elaborate
social affair. In the original simple form,
the hostess merely welcomes her guests as
they come to her on her regular day at
home, in the drawing-room, and there
offers them a cup of tea served by herself
and light refreshments of sandwiches and
cakes and the like.</p>

<p>The next development in the tea is in
the nature of a small afternoon reception,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
or at home. For this occasion, the hostess
issues invitations a week in advance. A
visiting-card serves the purpose, with a
line written below the name:</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Wednesday, June fourth<br />
from four until seven o’clock</i><br />
</p>

<p>If there is to be a guest of honor, an additional
line may indicate the fact:</p>

<p class="center">
<i>To meet</i>........................<br />
</p>

<p>The procedure for the hostess at a function
of this sort is more formal. It is usual
to have the refreshments in the dining-room,
though they should not be of an
elaborate character. The teapot is placed
at one end of the table, and presided over
by some friend, since the obligations of
the hostess prevent her rendering this hospitable
service in person.</p>

<p>The third stage of the afternoon tea has
come to take the place of the old-time reception,
though it bears merely the designation
“At Home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>The requisite invitations must be sent
out any time from a week to a fortnight
before the date set. For these, an engraved
form is essential. They are printed
on heavy white bristol board, of the quality
described for dinner-invitations, and inclosed
in a single envelope. They may be
issued in the name of the hostess alone,
or in the names of a hostess and her daughter
or daughters, or in the names of husband
and wife—though this last is a very
modern innovation. The following will
serve as a model:</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Mrs. James French Putnam<br />
<br />
At Home<br />
<br />
April the seventh<br />
<br />
From four until seven o’clock<br />
<br />
208 Flagg Avenue</i><br />
</p>

<p>If the husband joins with the wife in
issuing the invitations, the only change is
in the first line:</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Mr. and Mrs. James French Putnam</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Where a daughter is to receive with her
mother, the girl’s name appears just below
that of the matron:</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Mrs. James French Putnam</i><br />
<i>Miss Putnam</i><br />
</p>

<p>Where there are two or more daughters
thus associated with the mother, they are
included under one title. Thus:</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Mrs. James French Putnam</i><br />
<br />
<i>The Misses Putnam</i><br />
</p>

<p>When a younger sister is to appear at
her début, her name in full is given a
line after those of her mother and elder
sister:</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Mrs. James French Putnam</i><br />
<i>Miss Putnam</i><br />
<i>Miss Helen Louise Putnam</i><br />
</p>

<p>In the event of a guest of honor, the
invitation may emphasize the presence
of this personage by a special engraved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
announcement at the head of the invitation:</p>

<p class="center">
<i>To meet</i><br />
<br />
......................................<br />
</p>

<p>The remainder of the invitation will
follow any of the forms indicated above.</p>

<p>Or the announcement may appear in one
engraved line at the foot of the invitation:</p>

<p class="center">
<i>To meet</i>................................<br />
</p>

<p>At a reception of this character, the hostess
is obliged to remain on duty near the
door of the drawing-room throughout the
hours set. But a husband or daughter
receiving with her, though expected to join
her in receiving the guests at the outset
and for a considerable time afterward, is
not so rigidly held to the one place, but
after a time may properly move about
among the guests with hospitable intent.</p>

<p>But a débutante must remain at the
post of duty with her mother throughout
the whole time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>In recent years, there has developed a
pleasant custom by which the débutante
invites a number of her young friends to
join her in receiving the other guests. It
is usual to entertain these at dinner after
the reception.</p>

<p>The refreshments for an occasion of this
sort are served in the dining-room with servants
in attendance. Tea is poured at one
end of the table, and perhaps chocolate at
the other, while a bowl of punch is commonly
at hand. The refreshments are of
the buffet variety, but they may be as
rich and varied as the hostess chooses. At
such functions in the city, it is usual to
lay a strip of carpet from the house door
to the curb, and an awning raised over this
offers protection to the guests in inclement
weather. Where the list of guests is long,
a liveried servant at the curb not only
opens the doors of the motors, but also
issues checks by which the cars may
be summoned for the departure of the
guests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>A butler opens the house door as the
guest approaches, and gives directions as
to the dressing-rooms. Another liveried
servant at the door of the drawing-room
announces each guest by name to the
hostess.</p>

<p>At such affairs, both hostess and women
guests wear what is properly termed a reception-gown—that
is to say, one of elegance
and richness, with a train if the
prevailing mode permits, but not decolleté
or sleeveless. Hats of a character harmonious
with the gown are worn throughout
the function, as are gloves.</p>

<p>The men wear black frock coats and
gray striped trousers, with either a black
waistcoat or a fancy one according to
choice. While he leaves his coat and hat
in the dressing-room at such formal affairs,
a man retains his gloves, either keeping
the left glove on the hand, and carrying
the other, or carrying both. The right
hand must be bare.</p>

<p>Each woman guest leaves on a tray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
provided for that purpose in the hall a
card for her hostess and one for each of
any other women receiving. She may also
leave similarly the cards of any other
woman member of her family who has
been invited, but does not attend.</p>

<p>The man leaves a card for his host if
there is one, in addition to those for the
ladies.</p>

<p>No reply is necessary from one invited
to such a reception, either of acceptance
or of refusal. The presence of the guests
is deemed a sufficient answer. In the event
of non-attendance, the guest must be at
pains to send cards, and these should be
so timed in the sending that they will
reach their address on the day of the at
home, preferably in the afternoon.</p>

<p>At crowded affairs, the guest displays
good manners as well as good sense by
making the stay short. Twenty minutes
is a sufficient time, and departure should
not be delayed much beyond a half-hour.
It is better not to say farewell to the hostess,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
unless the going should be at a time
when few guests remain, and she is obviously
at leisure.</p>

<p>The punctilious guest will make a point
of arriving neither too early nor too late.
Between half-past four and six is recommended.</p>

<p>The formal evening reception is less
popular than in former days, but it still
prevails to a limited extent. The procedure
throughout is substantially the same as for
that of the afternoon reception. The wording
of the invitation is identical, with the
single exception of the time specified.</p>

affair, the costumes of the guests,
both men and women, are changed as befits
the change in hours. The men are
scrupulous in the exactitude of their evening
garb—swallow tail, white linen and
white cravat and white waistcoat, and
patent-leather shoes; while the women
array themselves in their handsomest evening
gowns, decolleté and sleeveless, and
display the richest of their jewels.</p>

<h2>BACHELOR HOSTS</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-w.jpg" width="124" height="131" alt="W" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">WHEN A BACHELOR entertains
either in the afternoon
or evening, he follows in a
general way the procedure
indicated for receptions
under the heading “At Homes.” If the
affair is to be elaborate, he may use engraved
invitations.</p>

</p>

<p>A word or two at the bottom on the left
may indicate any special entertainment,
such as <i>Music</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>But there are certain proprieties to be
observed that are peculiar to the bachelor.
For example, he is not permitted to use a
visiting-card with a line written on it for
less formal invitations. Instead, he must
write a note in the first person, or he may
give the invitation orally. The invitations
should be issued a week or a little
less before the appointed time.</p>

<p>There is one other requirement of vital
importance. The bachelor must always
have a chaperon present for any gathering
that includes both sexes. And she must be
invited by note, or orally—even in cases
where the formal engraved invitations are
employed.</p>

<p>The chaperon pours tea, and on occasions
when the guests are seated at table,
she is given the place on the host’s right,
unless there is a guest of honor, when she
is given the position on his left.</p>

<p>The other women guests must take their
departure at the same time as the chaperon,
unless they prefer an earlier hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>The presence of the chaperon at such
entertainments makes it unnecessary for
the unmarried girl to provide one for
herself.</p>

<p>The chaperon should be a married
woman, and her husband must be included
among the invited guests.</p>

<p>When a bachelor wishes to issue engraved
invitations for a formal dinner-party
or luncheon, he uses the forms provided
respectively in the chapters entitled
“Dinners” and “Luncheons.” The directions
as to breakfasts also will be found
appropriate in a general way as set forth
in the special chapter.</p>

<p>A bachelor should always be punctilious
in calling on a chaperon shortly after any
affair at which she has officiated, in order
to tender his grateful appreciation of her
services in his behalf.</p>

<h2>BALLS</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t2.jpg" width="130" height="140" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">THE INVITATIONS for a
formal ball are engraved on
a sheet similar to that used
for dinner-parties. But, like
the dinner-invitations, they
may also be written by the hostess. In
sending these invitations by mail only one
envelope is used when the invitation is
written out. But the engraved form is
enclosed first in an unsealed envelope
with merely the name of the guest on the
cover. This is put in a second envelope,
which is sealed and has both the name and
address written on it for posting. An engraved
invitation, however, when delivered
by a messenger requires only a single
envelope, sealed.</p>

<p>These invitations must be sent out not
less than ten days before the date of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
ball, and they may be issued three weeks
before the appointed time.</p>

<p>The accepted form may be either of those
following:</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Mr. and Mrs. George Wheatley<br />

<br />

<br />
Dancing    71 Hamilton Place</i><br />
</p>

<p>It is permissible to write the initials,
<i>R.s.v.p.</i> below the word <i>Dancing</i>.</p>

<p>In place of <i>Dancing</i>, the word <i>Cotillon</i>
may appear, if the whole evening is to be
devoted especially to this dance. So, too,
the words <i>Bal Poudré</i> may be substituted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
for <i>Dancing</i>, if the affair is to be a costume
ball. Or any other form of entertainment
may be similarly indicated.</p>

<p>The form used in accepting or declining
such an invitation follows exactly the wording
given in a later chapter in connection
with dinner-invitations.</p>

<p>It is the duty of the hostess to greet her
guests as at a dinner-party, and a daughter
or daughters may assist her in her hospitable
duties, but such assistance is not required
of them. The host, also, may join
his wife in receiving, and may make himself
socially useful by various attentions
to the guests. But such action on his part
is discretionary, except that in the case of
a woman guest of particular importance,
he should take her in to supper if this is
served at tables. Where a buffet supper
is served, it is fitting that he should escort
various guests from time to time.</p>

<p>It is not always necessary to invite
mothers or chaperons to a private ball,
and in that case a girl may be sent with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
a maid to accompany her. When the
mother receives an invitation and accepts
it, she may choose not to remain, but to
leave after entrusting her daughter to the
care of the hostess, or some other friend.</p>

<p>At elaborate dances, the supper at midnight
is served on small tables, at which
the guests are seated. The buffet supper is
popular on account of its convenience,
since the guests select whatever pleases
them at any time.</p>

<p>Unlike the rule as to dinners, there is no
obligation for prompt arrival on the ball
guest. Likewise, the guest may leave at
any time. It is not necessary to seek the
hostess for a farewell, but if she is near,
she should be addressed with appropriate
phrase in appreciation of the hospitality
that has been enjoyed.</p>

<p>A girl at a ball usually establishes herself
in a seat by her chaperon, to whom
she returns according to her convenience
after dancing. It is perfectly proper for
her, if at any time she wishes to be rid of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
a partner, to ask that he accompany her
back to this seat beside her chaperon.</p>

<p>Evening clothes are essential for the
male guest at a ball, and the wearing of
white gloves is obligatory. A careful man
is very likely to provide himself with an
extra pair. At informal dances, ungloved
men often cover the hand with a handkerchief
to avoid any risk of soiling a partner’s
bodice. If a man serves as escort for a
woman, or for a girl and her chaperon, it is
a part of his duty to provide a carriage to
and fro.</p>

<p>The ball-dress for women is usually the
most elegant their taste and means will
contrive. It is always decolleté, and commonly
sleeveless.</p>

<h2>BREAKFASTS</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="136" height="141" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">A &nbsp; HOSTESS MAY USE her
visiting-card for invitations
to breakfast, simply writing
on it below her name:</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Breakfast at eleven o’clock<br />

</p>

<p>A more formal affair may have an engraved
invitation on paper similar to that
used in the case of dinners. This would
have the following form:</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Mrs. George Vinton Thorne<br />

</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Or the hostess may, if she prefers, write
a brief note of invitation in the first person.
Whatever form is employed, the invitations
should be sent out a full week, or a
little more, before the date set for the
breakfast.</p>

<p>The answer to such an invitation should
be sent promptly, whether in acceptance
or in refusal. The form is identical with
that for dinner-invitations, except that the
word <i>breakfast</i> is substituted for the word
<i>dinner</i>.</p>

<p>Where the invitation is a note written
in the first person, the answer must follow
the same style.</p>

<p>A breakfast of the more informal sort,
with no more than eight or ten guests, may
begin as early as ten o’clock, but a later
hour is preferred for very ceremonious
affairs, with noon most esteemed as the
hour.</p>

<p>Grapefruit is usually served, with finger-bowl
accompaniment, and the meal that
follows may be as simple or as elaborate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
as the taste and resources of the hostess
dictate.</p>

<p>Usually both sexes are included among
the guests at a breakfast. The women
remove their gloves after taking their
places at table, but not their hats. Veils
may be removed entirely or pushed up
out of the way, according to the wearer’s
choice.</p>

<p>The guest should remain at least a half-hour
after the conclusion of the meal, but
not longer than an hour unless justified by
exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p>Frock or cutaway coats are worn by the
men, and afternoon dress by the women.
The costumes for a ten o’clock breakfast
should be somewhat plainer than for one
at the more formal hour of noon.</p>

<h2>CALLS</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-f.jpg" width="128" height="128" alt="F" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">FORMAL CALLS are to be
made in the afternoon between
three o’clock and
half-past five.</p>

<p>If a hostess has a day at
home, formal calls on her should be made
on that day. It is well also so to time visits
for congratulation or to return thanks for
any hospitality, or the like, as to have them
also fall on the day at home. Usually, a
due attention by visitors to this set time
for calling is appreciated by a hostess.</p>

<p>While the formal hours for calls are in
the afternoon as indicated above, the time
varies in different neighborhoods. Evening
calls are common in the country necessarily
as a matter of convenience. And, while in
the city women pay no formal calls on
Sunday, these are permitted in smaller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
places. Ordinarily, too, there is license in
the country as to the length even of formal
calls, which may be extended without impropriety
far beyond the limit of fifteen or
twenty minutes which is well established
in the city. A new resident or visitor in
any community should be at pains to get
information as to the local usage, and conform
to it in all details.</p>

<p>It is permissible for men in our country
to make social calls in the afternoon on
Sunday, or in the evening. The exigencies
of business are the excuse for the departure
from the stricter form, which still holds in
the case of women. The hour of such evening
calls in the larger cities is from eight to
nine, but the time is earlier in smaller
towns and in the country. In every instance,
the local custom is to be followed.
Of course, too, men of leisure may pay
their calls in the afternoon.</p>

<p>New residents in a neighborhood must
await calls from those already established
there. In the city, the first calls of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
social season should be received by the
hostess who first sends out her at-home
cards. Where women have met out of
town, and wish to continue the acquaintance
in the city, the unmarried woman
should call on the matron, or one who is
under any obligation for hospitality should
make the first call. Unless a distinction
be drawn for some such reason, either may
properly pay the first visit.</p>

<p>It is notorious that in the large cities
there is no welcome for the newcomer from
the dweller next door or across the street.
The conditions of city life justify such
aloofness. On the other hand, the conditions
of life in the smaller places warrant
exactly the opposite in the matter of hospitality.
It is the recognized duty of the
older residents to welcome new arrivals by
calling on them promptly, after the strangers
have had time to dispose themselves
comfortably.</p>

<p>There are many varieties of those calls
that are imposed by formal courtesy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Thus, in the matter of weddings, it becomes
the duty of any one who has taken
official part in the affair, such as a bride’s-maid
or a best man, to call on the mother
of the bride within a few days after the
marriage ceremony, and also to call on
the bride immediately after her return
from the honeymoon trip. The like duty
devolves on invited guests to a home wedding,
to a wedding-reception and to a
wedding-breakfast.</p>

<p>A similar formal call should be paid to
the hostess by each guest at a dinner, or
breakfast, or other special entertainment.
Such a call must be made within two
weeks. The obligation is the same even in
cases where the invitation has been declined.</p>

<p>As to the returning of calls, such visits
should be made on the day at home if
there is one, and otherwise at a suitable
time according to the social usage of the
neighborhood within a fortnight. But this
ruling applies properly only to the return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
for a first call. Afterward, a longer or
shorter interval may elapse between visits
according to the desire of the parties concerned.
A former acquaintance may be
maintained merely by an annual exchange
of calls. It must be noted, however, that
a call in person demands a personal visit
in return. The formal leaving of a card at
the door does not suffice.</p>

<p>Persons giving up their residence in a
community or going on a long journey
should send their cards to their full visiting-list
with the initials <i>P.p.c.</i> (<i>Pour prendre
congé</i>, for leave-taking).</p>

<p>It occurs often that a person wishes to
call on a friend in the home of a stranger.
Such a call is permissible, but the visitor
should ask for the hostess as well as the
friend, and leave a card for her.</p>

<p>In the matter of initiative, it is fitting
that an elder woman should invite a
younger to the exchange of cards and
calls, and that the matron should thus
invite the maiden. Where there is equality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of years or station, the first advance must
depend on the personal inclinations of the
parties.</p>

<p>The proprieties in reference to calls between
women are thus seen to be simple
enough. There is more complexity in the
procedure when it has to do with the calling
of men on women. It is not deemed
proper for a young unmarried woman to
invite calls from men. Such visits on their
part are left to the discretion of the mother
or chaperon. But, undoubtedly, the débutante
will see to it that mother or chaperon
does not fail in her functions. As
to the older women, and those married,
there is some variation locally in the polite
usage. Sometimes the woman feels it her
privilege to invite the man to call without
awaiting solicitation on his part; sometimes
she requires that the advance should
be on the part of the man in the form of
a request for permission to visit her.</p>

<p>If any person requires that a definite
time should be given for the emancipation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
of a girl from the social dominance of her
mother or chaperon, it may be set at about
the twenty-fifth year, after which time a
young woman is theoretically fitted to
decide for herself as to who her visitors
shall be.</p>

<p>A young woman of sensibility will be
extremely chary of her invitations to men,
and very sure before extending them that
they are really desired. If at any time a
man fails to avail himself of such an invitation,
her self-respect will not permit her
to repeat it.</p>

<p>The strictness of the above rules of conduct
has been greatly relaxed in the case
of the average American girl, who democratically
insists from the outset of her
social career on her own choice in the
matter of acquaintances and friends. But
even this laxity does not permit an invitation
to a man on the first meeting.
Such haste is neither good form nor ordinary
prudence.</p>

<p>In a consideration of formal calls, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
should be noted that in practise the offices
of the wife are commonly accepted in her
husband’s behalf by her leaving his card
when she pays her dinner-call, or the like.
The exigencies of business are supposed to
justify this vicarious method.</p>

<p>While it is proper for a woman to call
upon a man for business reasons, social
calls are forbidden.</p>

<p>Calls of condolence, except when there
is an intimate friendship, are properly made
by leaving a card. The expression of
sympathy is usually best made by a brief
note.</p>

<p>Calls of congratulation may be made by
acquaintances of both sexes on a woman
who announces her engagement to be married.
Calls following the announcement
of a birth are expected by the mother from
the women of her acquaintance.</p>

<p>The day at home is such a social convenience
that it is popular, not only in the
cities, but in many smaller towns. It is
usually set for one afternoon in the week,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
sometimes for an afternoon each two weeks
during the social season. The day should
appear on the visiting-card. The hours
for entertaining on the day at home are
from three until six, but this period is
frequently extended for another hour. The
hostess should devote herself assiduously
to her guests, and should provide some
light forms of food and drink. Usually,
tea is served. Sufficient notice is given
of the day at home by sending out the
visiting-cards at the beginning of the
season. One advantage of the day at
home is that it justifies the hostess in not
receiving casual callers on other occasions.</p>

<p>It is the duty of the hostess to meet
and address each guest with a handshake.
“How do you do, Mrs. Smith? I am so
glad to see you!” or a similar phrase, should
be used in greeting each arrival. She
should also introduce strangers to other
guests near by. She should not leave the
reception-room to make her farewells to
departing guests, unless in case of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
person of particular distinction. “Good-afternoon,
Mr. Brown. I shall hope to
see you again very soon,” or the like,
affords a sufficient form of farewell.</p>

<p>If the husband is present during his
wife’s at home, he should undertake to
second her hospitable efforts to the best
of his ability, showing attention to any
requiring it.</p>

<p>A woman caller does not remove her
gloves or veil, or even her wrap, unless it
is a heavy one. But rubbers and umbrella
and any heavy outer garment should be
left in the hall.</p>

<p>For a man, formal politeness permits
the carrying of both hat and stick into the
drawing-room. But this rule is to-day
more honored in the breach than in the
observance. And, too, the right hand at
least is usually ungloved. The hat and
stick, when carried, are held in the left
hand, and should be retained throughout
the call, though it is permissible to put
them down on the floor beside one, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
greater convenience when taking refreshments.</p>

<p>When the day at home is of a formal
sort, the women do not exchange kisses in
greeting, and the gloves are not taken off
even when tea is drunk.</p>

<h2>CARDS</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-v.jpg" width="124" height="130" alt="V" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">VISITING-CARDS are of
three sizes, which remain
practically the same year
after year. The largest is
that used by matrons, while
that of the unmarried woman is a very little
smaller, and that of the man much smaller.
The present style as to materials favors a
polished bristol board that is white and
substantial without being too heavy. This
should be printed from an engraved plate
in black ink. The lettering may be a running
script or old English.</p>

<p>Under no circumstances should a woman’s
card carry any prefix other than <i>Mrs.</i> or
<i>Miss</i>, but one or the other of these invariably
appears. This rule does not apply in
the case of professional women who may
wish a distinctive card for business purposes,
with its prefix of <i>Dr.</i> or <i>Rev.</i> Such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
a card would also carry the address in the
lower right-hand corner and perhaps office-hours
in the lower left-hand corner. But
even the professional woman requires the
plainer form of card for social purposes.</p>

<p>There is a tendency at present to give the
name in full on the card. For example,
<i>Mrs. John James Smith</i>, or <i>Miss Maude
MacArthur</i>.</p>

<p>It is permissible for the senior matron of
a family to use only the family name on
her card with the prefix: for example,
<i>Mrs. Fuller</i>. It is more common, however,
to omit the Christian name of an eldest
daughter who is unmarried: <i>Miss Fuller</i>.
The other daughters require the Christian
name on their cards: <i>Miss Mary Fuller</i>,
<i>Miss Gladys Fuller</i>.</p>

<p>The tendency in this country is strongly
against the omission of the name in either
of the above cases. Although it is perfectly
correct as a social usage, it is opposed to
the spirit of our institutions.</p>

<p>There is some variation in the use of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
name on the card in the case of a widow.
It is within the woman’s choice whether
she will continue to use the Christian name
of her husband on the card, or will put
her own in place of it. In other words, she
may use the same cards after the death of
her husband as before if she prefers, or she
may follow the <i>Mrs.</i> with her own Christian
name. A common form to-day gives the
woman’s Christian name and the surname
to which she was born and finally the surname
of her husband. A present vogue
permits also the use of only the two surnames,
without the Christian name. Thus,
Mary Brown marries James Robinson. The
husband dies and the widow changes her
visiting-cards, which have read, <i>Mrs.
James Robinson</i>, so that they now read,
<i>Mrs. Mary Robinson</i>. Then presently she
grows ambitious socially and has her cards
changed to read, <i>Mrs. Mary Brown Robinson</i>.
Soon, she seizes on a newer style, and
again changes her cards in accordance with
it to read, <i>Mrs. Brown Robinson</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>It should be noted that the variations in
cards practised by widows are used also
by divorced women. And when a divorcée
resumes her maiden name she properly
uses with it the prefix <i>Mrs.</i>, not <i>Miss</i>.</p>

<p>As a matter of strict propriety, a girl
during her first social season does not formally
use an individual card. Her name
appears below that of her mother in the
same lettering. When making calls unaccompanied
by her mother, the latter’s
name is crossed out with a pencil mark.</p>

<p>Where two daughters of nearly the same
age are concerned, both are included on
the mother’s card by the words <i>The Misses</i>,
followed by the family name.</p>

<p>The above details are applied especially
to a débutante in the first season. Afterward,
a young woman uses her own individual
card when calling alone. But this
card should not carry on it the day at
home. The at-home statement appears
on the mother’s individual card. It is
given also on the card combining the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
names of mother and daughter. The combination
card may with correctness be
frequently used in appropriate circumstances
until the daughter’s marriage.</p>

<p>The notice of the day at home is placed
in the lower left-hand corner of the card.
Only the day of the week is given, or with
such qualification as may be required if
the at-home day is not of weekly recurrence.
The hours should not be specified
unless they are a distinct variation from
the customary time, between three and
six. In addition, a time limit to the at
homes may be specified. Thus, <i>Fridays
until March</i>. Of course, the beginning is
set for any individual by reception of the
card.</p>

<p>A married woman finds frequent use for
a card in combination with her husband,
though this by no means takes the place
of her individual cards, and, while it bears
the address in the lower right-hand corner,
does not usually give the at-home day.
This card may properly be used for those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
formal occasions in which her husband is
concerned. For example, it may fittingly
accompany a gift from husband and wife.
It serves also for announcing a marriage
with the residence of the bridal couple.</p>

<p>A man’s visiting-card always carries the
prefix <i>Mr.</i> The single exception to this
is when <i>Jr.</i> follows the name. The name
is commonly given in full, but it is permissible
to use only the initial of the middle
name. It is strictly proper for the male
head of a family to use only the family
name on his card, preceded by <i>Mr.</i> Thus,
the head of the Smiths—could he be
located—might use on his visiting-card
merely <i>Mr. Smith</i>, instead of <i>Mr. John
Smith</i>.</p>

<p>The home address appears in the lower
right-hand corner of the card, and a bachelor
may add also the name of a club in the
lower left-hand corner. The business address,
of course, should never appear on
the card used for social purposes. Likewise,
a day at home should not be given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
by a bachelor even though he may entertain
regularly.</p>

<p>It is a safe rule to avoid titles on the
visiting-cards of men as of women. The
only exceptions are in instances little likely
to concern the average reader of this book.
Such instances are afforded by the President
of the United States, the Vice-President,
Ambassadors, the higher Judiciary,
Army and Navy Officers, clergymen and
physicians. The custom in the army, however,
forbids any prefix except plain <i>Mr.</i>
to an officer below the rank of Captain.</p>

<p>In the case of all officers the nature of
his command is properly stated in a lower
corner of the card.</p>

<p>Lawyers and physicians should have
only the home address on the card used
for social purposes. Another card with
the business address should be used for
business purposes. But <i>Dr.</i> is properly
used by the physician in place of <i>Mr.</i> on
his visiting-cards. Likewise, a clergyman
uses <i>Reverend</i>, or its abbreviation <i>Rev.</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
on all his cards, which are commonly identical
for both social and professional uses.</p>

<p>The letters indicative of degrees are not
given after the name on the visiting-card,
though a single exception is sometimes
made by clergymen who omit <i>Rev.</i> before
their names and, in lieu of it, use <i>D.D.</i>
following the name.</p>

<p>When it becomes necessary, for any reason,
to write one’s name on a visiting-card,
the prefix <i>Mr.</i> should be given, following
the ordinary form of the engraved card.</p>

<p>Care should be taken in the case of
mourning-cards to avoid a too ostentatious
parade of grief by an unduly broad margin
of black. Somewhat less than a half inch
is permissible for a widow’s card, and,
after the first year, it is well to have this
width reduced. Often, other reductions
in the size of the border are made at intervals
of six months, as long as the period of
mourning continues.</p>

<p>The card of a widower must carry a
border proportionately narrower, as its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
size is smaller than a woman’s card, but
the decrease in width is made after the same
manner.</p>

<p>When a woman elects to remain in
mourning permanently, the narrow black
border may be retained throughout her
lifetime.</p>

<p>It is not customary to make variations
in the mourning border for the commemoration
of persons other than husband or
wife. For these, a fitting width is about
a twelfth part of an inch, which remains
the same throughout the period of
mourning.</p>

<p>When a call is made on a day at home,
the card or cards are commonly left in the
hall on a tray placed for that purpose. A
married woman calling on the at-home day
of another married woman for the first
time in the season leaves her own card
and two of her husband’s cards. But
in later calls on the at-home day she
leaves her card and the two cards of her
husband’s only when the call acknowledges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
entertainment offered to them by
the hostess.</p>

<p>There has been considerable simplification
in recent years as to the leaving of
cards. They are no longer weirdly bent
in sign of delivery in person, and a smaller
number are used. Thus, though the hostess
referred to above may have unmarried
daughters receiving with her, cards for
them need not be left. But the presence
of a married daughter or a friend formally
assisting in the reception of the
guests requires the leaving of a card.</p>

<p>A woman leaves no cards for the men
of the family where she visits.</p>

<p>It is the business of the wife to fulfill
her husband’s formal social duties by leaving
his cards with hers whenever entertainment
should be acknowledged.</p>

<p>Where two spinsters share a residence,
a woman caller, the first time in the season,
should leave two of her cards, and also, if
she is a married woman, two of her husband’s.
So, too, a card should be left for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
a daughter or sister who is hostess of the
house, even though she may be unmarried.</p>

<p>When an unmarried girl uses her individual
card, she should follow the procedure
indicated for the matron in the
use of hers. Or she may use the combination
card of her mother and herself as already
described above.</p>

<p>A call on a mother and daughter who
are out requires the leaving of two cards.
The same procedure is necessary in the
case of a hostess who has a friend staying
with her. Likewise, a call made
on a friend who is a guest in another’s
house demands the leaving of two cards.
This rule applies in the case of a man as
well as of a woman. It should be observed
that two cards are deemed sufficient in
most cases. Where, however, the hostess
has a guest staying with her and also
daughters of her own, three cards are to
be left.</p>

<p>A man wishing to call on a particular
woman must be punctilious in leaving cards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
not only for the particular one in whom he
is interested, but also for the mother or
chaperon, and still a third for the host.
But, if a call is made on a woman on her
at-home day, no card need be left, unless
the call is in acknowledgment of entertainment.
In the latter case, a single card
is left for the host. It is advisable, however,
that in his first call he should leave
a card for convenience in the matter of
address.</p>

<p>It is permissible on certain occasions to
leave visiting-cards with the servant at
the door, or to send them through the mail
or by a messenger, instead of making the
call in person. Sometimes a woman who
is owing a call thus sends her card along
with an invitation, as for luncheon or dinner.
The invitation is considered to justify
the merely formal matter of the card. So,
too, a person receiving an invitation from
a hostess who is a stranger must, if the
invitation is declined, leave cards within
two weeks after the date of the entertainment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
An invalid may send cards through
the post in acknowledgment of calls of
inquiry, and a woman in mourning is able
to fulfill her obligations in the same manner.
Cards are formally left by all who
receive invitations to a church wedding,
and the requirement is the same for those
to whom an announcement of the marriage
is sent. Such cards are demanded of men
and women both, to be left for the mother
of the bride within a fortnight after the
ceremony. Cards are left within a proper
time after any form of entertainment to
which the members of a club are invited,
though there may be no other social acquaintance
with the hostess. In calls of
condolence or inquiry, cards are always
left. They may be used also, as hereinbefore
stated, to announce a prolonged
absence or a change of address.</p>

<p>When cards are left in person, they are
delivered to the servant at the door. One
or two or three are to be left according
to the circumstances. The caller should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
tell the servant the persons for whom the
cards are designed.</p>

<p>Good taste dictates that calls of inquiry
concerning the condition of a sick person
should be made in person. Cards should
be left at the time of such calls, except in
the case of intimates. The cards should
not be mailed or sent by messenger.</p>

<p>Acknowledgment of cards of condolence
are made after a funeral by a large black-edged
card of thanks, which should be sent
within a month. Such cards are usually
merely printed, not engraved. The wording
should be of the simplest.</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Mrs. Jack Robinson<br />
<br />
returns thanks to<br />
<br />
.............................<br />
<br />
for her kind sympathy</i><br />
</p>

<p>The address of the one sending the card
should appear at the bottom.</p>

<p>The form is varied according to circumstances.
Thus:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">
<i>Mrs. Montgomery James and Family<br />
return thanks for your kind sympathy</i><br />
</p>

<p>Some persons prefer to leave their visiting-cards
with the mourning border on
those to whom acknowledgment is due,
instead of sending the special card by
mail. Personal calls, however, are not
made by those in mourning within three
months at least of the time of the funeral.
If earlier acknowledgment is to be made,
the visiting-card with mourning-border may
be sent by mail within a few weeks. A
word of thanks should be written on the
card. For example:</p>

<p class="center">
<i>With grateful appreciation of your sympathy</i><br />
</p>

<p>The use of <i>P.p.c.</i> cards has already been
described in the chapter on calls. It should
be added that they are convenient when
one is leaving on short notice without time
to pay in person all calls due. The <i>P.p.c.</i>
card involves no duty of acknowledgment
on the part of its recipient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>A woman temporarily stopping in any
place sends cards containing her address
to any acquaintances she may have there.
Her ordinary visiting-card serves the purpose,
with a pencil line drawn through the
engraved address and the temporary one
written above it. But a man, in the same
circumstances, makes his calls in person.</p>

<p>The new-born infant embarks on its
social career by means of the card. The
birth of a child is made known to the
mother’s social list by mailing the mother’s
card, which has tied to it by a strip of
white satin ribbon a card only a quarter
as large carrying the full name of the baby.
In this case, the prefix <i>Mr.</i> or <i>Miss</i> is
omitted, but the date of birth appears in
a lower corner. The recipients of these
cards are required to call with inquiry as
to the health of the senders, and to leave
their cards in return. Persons residing
at a distance may post their cards of acknowledgment,
with a penciled phrase of
congratulation.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">FORMAL INVITATIONS
to dinner should be sent
between five and ten days
before the date. A hostess
may use her own discretion
as to whether she will write the invitations
by hand or use an engraved form. The
wording is the same in either case.</p>

<p>The engraved form should be printed on
a large, heavy piece of bristol board in old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
English or block type, or in script. When
the dinner has a guest of honor, notice of

bottom of the invitation:</p>

<p class="center">

</p>

<p>Or a special small card may be inclosed
with the invitation, on which is engraved a
similar phrase.</p>

<p>When the affair is of extraordinary importance,
the form of invitation may dignify
the purpose by announcing it at the
outset.</p>

<p>This form may be varied according to
the taste of the writer and the degree of
intimacy with the person to whom the
invitation is sent.</p>

<p>When it becomes necessary to invite some
one to take the place of a guest who is
unable to be present, this late invitation
should not be of the formal sort, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
should be contained in a note frankly explaining
the circumstances. Such invitations,
of course, are never made to merely
formal acquaintances.</p>

<p>The custom formerly prevailed of writing
the initials <i>R.s.v.p.</i>, on the dinner invitations,
the initials of the French words,
répondez, s’il vous plaît (reply if you
please). But this usage has lost favor.</p>

<p>An invitation to dinner demands an immediate
answer, either accepting or declining.
The invitation cannot be accepted

</div>

<p>The invitation in the form of a note is
answered similarly by a note. Thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<i>42 Chestnut Street<br />
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">April 30, 1919</span></i><br />
</p>

<i>My Dear Mrs. Morehouse:</i>

<p><i>It is with much pleasure that
I accept your kind invitation to dinner
on Tuesday evening, the sixth,
at half-past seven o’clock.</i></p>

<p class="sig">
<i><span style="margin-right: 2em;">Yours sincerely,</span><br />
Helen Potter</i><br />
</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>A declination should state a courteous
reason.</p>

<p>All such answers are addressed to the
hostess alone. If she is married the husband
is, nevertheless, omitted from the
address.</p>

<p>The reply to an informal invitation
should always be correspondingly informal.</p>

<p>For a formal dinner, there should be an
even number of guests, eight or ten, or
more, with the sexes evenly divided.</p>

<p>Either a round or square table will serve,
but it should be large enough to accommodate
all the party without crowding.</p>

<p>A pad should cover the table. The white
cloth over this should be so large that the
corners reach nearly to the floor.</p>

<p>A folded napkin is placed on each plate,
with a roll or piece of bread laid within it.
Three forks are laid to the left of the plate,
with prongs up. Two steel knives are to
the right of the plate, and then a silver
knife, the edge of each to the left. A soup
spoon follows the silver knife, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
an oyster fork. Other utensils are sometimes
added, but are not necessary.</p>

<p>A goblet for water is placed before the
knives. With it are grouped whatever
wine glasses may be required. A small
card lying on the napkin carries the name
of the guest to be seated here.</p>

<p>When dinner is announced, the host
offers his arm to the woman who is to sit
on his right, and leads the way to the
dining-room. Already, in welcoming the
guests, the hostess has made known the
dinner-partners, introducing them when
necessary. These now follow in pairs to
the dining-room. The hostess brings up the
rear. The guests find their places by the
cards.</p>

<p>The hostess does not rise in greeting a
late arrival, even a woman. But the host
does, and sees to the seating of the laggard.</p>

<p>It has long been the custom for the ladies
to leave the dining-room after the fruit
course, and to have coffee served in the
drawing-room. In such case, the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
stand until the women have passed out.
Afterward, they seat themselves where
they please, and smoking is permitted. The
present-day tendency, however, is toward
lessening the time of this separation and
often doing away with it altogether, especially
at less formal dinners, which otherwise
follow an essentially identical routine.</p>

<p>Both host and hostess must say farewell,
standing, with a handclasp, to each guest.</p>

<p>As for the guest, his first duty is to arrive
exactly on time. Fifteen minutes of delay
is the limit.</p>

<p>On ceremonious occasions, the hostess
writes a lady’s name on a card, and places
it in an envelope. This is given to the
male guest on his arrival by a servant, and
from it he learns the identity of the one
he is to take in to dinner. When the dinner
is announced, he offers his arm, and
escorts the woman into the dining-room,
where he pulls out her chair, and stands
until she is seated.</p>

<p>It is permissible for dinner-partners,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
after the opening courses, to give some
attention to their other immediate neighbors.</p>

<p>A guest is free to leave at any time after
the conclusion of the dinner. Usually, an
hour is long enough to remain after the
meal is ended.</p>

<p>In taking leave, the guest must express
a courteous appreciation of the hospitality
that has been extended.</p>

<p>“I am under deep obligation to you, Mrs.
Johnson, for a most delightful evening.”</p>

<p>This, or any similar pleasant phrases of
gratitude, will serve. The words of appreciation
should be particularly addressed to
the hostess always.</p>

<p>Evening dress is required for all guests
at a formal dinner. For men, the regulation
swallow-tail is imperative. The wearing
of a dinner-jacket is not allowable on
any occasion of ceremony.</p>

<h2>GARDEN-PARTIES</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-g.jpg" width="124" height="131" alt="G" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">GARDEN-PARTIES are probably
destined to grow in
popularity in this century,
for they offer one of the
simplest and most pleasant
forms of entertainment during those seasons
when the outdoors is attractive.</p>

<p>For such an affair, the hostess sends out
invitations about ten days beforehand.
These may be engraved on white bristol
board, in which case either one of two
forms is permissible.</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Mrs. Melville Stratton<br />

</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>Or:</p>

<br />
from four until seven o’clock<br />
<br />
Garden-Party   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Nine Park Square</i><br />
</p>

<p>If less pretentiousness is preferred for the
occasion, the hostess may merely use a
visiting-card. Below her name she writes:</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Garden-Party, April third, four to<br />
seven o’clock.</i><br />
</p>

<p>Still a third method of issuing the invitations
is by means of a short note, written
in the first person.</p>

<p>The formal engraved invitation demands
a prompt reply, written in the third person.
An acceptance might properly take this
mode of expression:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Clinton Brewster<br />
<br />

<br />
Mrs. Stratton’s kind invitation<br />
<br />
for April third.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">Thirty Abernethey Row</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">May twenty-fifth, 1919</span></i><br />
</p>

<p>A refusal might be in the following form:</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Clinton Brewster<br />
<br />
regret that a previous engagement<br />
<br />
prevents their acceptance<br />
<br />
of Mrs. Stratton’s kind invitation<br />
<br />
for April third<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">Thirty Abernethey Row</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">May twenty-fifth, 1919</span></i><br />
</p>

<p>When the invitation is by means of the
visiting-card, an answer is not obligatory.
Yet, it is well to acknowledge this form of
invitation, also, by sending a short note
written in the first person, either accepting
or refusing.</p>

<p>Of course, when the invitation itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
takes the form of a note, the answer should
follow the same style.</p>

<p>It is part of the duty of the hostess to
put her house in order, as well as the
grounds. The guests on arriving may, in
many cases, go within before greeting the
hostess, to lay aside wraps or heavy veils.
Moreover, weather conditions may make
it necessary to seek shelter indoors. It
is often convenient also to have the refreshments
set out on the porch. These should
include hot and cold tea, punch or claret-cup,
cakes, sandwiches, salads, fruits in
season, and the like, which are partaken of
by the guests according to their pleasure.</p>

<p>Or a marquée may shelter the refreshments—a
tent roof set up at any desired
place on the lawn.</p>

<p>The hostess receives her guests on the
lawn. She wears an afternoon gown, suitable
for the season, and a hat. But, if she
prefers, she may leave off the hat, and use
a parasol in its stead.</p>

<p>The women guests, too, wear their most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
effective afternoon gowns and also hats and
veils and gloves, which are not taken off.</p>

<p>The men may wear frock or morning
coats and silk hats, and this garb is common
at garden-parties in England. In
this country, however, more comfortable
clothes are popular, and flannels, or other
fabrics of light material, are favored.</p>

<p>Guests leave their cards on a tray provided
for that purpose in the hallway of
the house. The requirements concerning
cards have already been fully explained in
the chapters on cards and at homes.</p>

<p>After greeting the hostess, a guest must
remain for at least twenty minutes, and
may properly continue on throughout the
whole afternoon.</p>

<p>Discretion should be used in the matter
of saying farewell. It should be omitted if
the hostess is occupied. If she is free, good-bye
may be spoken, and with it a phrase
in appreciation of the hospitality.</p>

<h2>HOUSE-PARTIES</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t3.jpg" width="131" height="138" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">THE HOUSE-PARTY is
made up of any number of
guests, from half a dozen to
a score, and may be merely
for a few days or for any
desired length of time. But, whatever is to
be the length of the guest’s stay, it should
be specifically stated in the invitation. It
is a common saying that an invitation that
sets no time for the visit is no invitation
at all, and the saying is quite true.</p>

<p>So, in writing her invitation, a hostess
mentions the exact day for the guest’s
arrival, and, as well, the exact day of departure.
The invitation is always a note
written in the first person. The following
may serve as an illustration:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<i>The Oaks, Hyde Park.<br />
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">April 10, 1919.</span></i><br />
</p>

<i>Dear Mrs. Ashland:</i>

<p><i>I should be delighted to have you
come to us for the next week-end, and I
hope that there is no previous engagement
to prevent your giving us this
pleasure.</i></p>

<p><i>The best train for you to take
from the city is the one leaving at three
in the afternoon. Mr. Lawrence will
meet this at the station here on Friday.</i></p>

<p><i>In eager anticipation of your visit,
believe me,</i></p>

<p class="sig">
<i><span style="margin-right: 2em;">Cordially yours,</span><br />
Ella Lawrence</i><br />
</p></div>

<p>The guest’s answer to the invitation must
be of the promptest, whether it accepts or
rejects the proposal of a visit. It should,
of course, be written in the first person.
The wording is a matter for the individual
taste, and the form following is offered
merely as a suggestion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class="right">
<i><span style="margin-right: 1em;">47 Tremont St.,</span><br />
New York.</i><br />
<i><span style="margin-right: 1em;">April 11, 1919.</span></i><br />
</div>

<i>Dear Mrs. Lawrence:</i>

<p><i>I am more pleased than I can tell
you to receive your kind invitation, since
there is nothing to prevent my acceptance
of it. I shall take the three o’clock train
on Friday afternoon for Hyde Park,
and I am looking forward very eagerly
to being with you so soon.</i></p>

<p class="sig">
<i><span style="margin-right: 2em;">Yours sincerely,</span><br />
Roberta Ashland</i><br />
</p></div>

<p>The declination of the invitation should
contain some fitting expression of regret,
and an explanation as to the causes that
render an acceptance impossible.</p>

<p>It is imperative that a girl should be met
at the station by her host in person, or, if
convenient, preferably by the hostess, or
perhaps by both. But this attention is
not obligatory in the case of a married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
couple or with a bachelor guest. But
these, too, should be met at the station
by a servant if not by the host, and duly
conveyed to the house where they are to
be entertained.</p>

<p>The guest on arrival should be welcomed
at the entrance by the hostess, if she has
not been to the station, and after the
greetings she escorts the guest, if this is a
woman, to the chamber she is to occupy,
and there leaves her to freshen herself
after the journey.</p>

<p>When the luggage is brought in, a competent
maid will unpack it and distribute
the contents through the drawers of the
bureau and in the closet, and render such
other services as may be required. A less
competent maid can at least unstrap the
luggage, remove trays, and help in the disposal
of the contents.</p>

<p>In the case of a man, after being greeted
by his hostess, he is conducted to his
room by the host.</p>

<p>The wardrobe requirements for the visitor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
at a house-party are regulated by the probable
nature of the entertainment that will
be provided, by the season of the year, and
by the particular social status of the hosts.
No hard-and-fast rule can be given. Thus,
where a woman visits a country house for
a few days in the summer, she needs no
larger wardrobe than can be carried in the
tiniest of trunks, suitcase and hat-box.
The hat used for traveling will serve her
also on occasion during the visit, but she
will need in addition a sport-hat for tramping
or out-door games and another hat of
sufficient elegance for wear at a lawn party
or wherever more elaborate dress is necessary.
The frocks should follow the lines
thus indicated, and there should be a sufficiency
of dainty waists and footgear besides
the inevitable decolleté gowns for
evening wear.</p>

<p>For the man, also, evening clothes are
essential, and he should be provided
with flannels, besides the business suit in
which he travels. For winter, the change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
in season would demand a corresponding
change in the matter of dress, especially
for out of doors.</p>

<p>The hostess plans sufficient entertainment
for her guests, but, if she is discreet,
she does not plan too many things. It is
customary to leave the mornings to the
devices of the guests, to be occupied by
them according to their individual pleasure.
Where a morning start is required on some
expedition, such as a picnic, the hostess is
likely to leave the evening free from any
special entertainment.</p>

<p>It is the duty of the guest to conform to
the habits of the household. If the party
assembles together for breakfast, he or she
must make one of the number though the
hour may be too early or too late for personal
convenience. Likewise, the guest
should accept such disposal of his or her
time as the hostess may choose to make,
even when the preference would be quite
otherwise. The tactful hostess, of course,
studies the likes and dislikes of her guests,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and seeks to reconcile her hospitality so
far as possible to their prejudices.</p>

<p>It is customary to give tips on leaving a
house-party to those servants with whom
the guest has been brought more closely
in contact. The maid who has attended to
the room should receive a dollar from the
visitor for a few days; the butler, if there
is one, should receive a dollar and a half.
The amount for the chauffeur should be
regulated to some extent by his personal
service in the guest’s behalf. Where there
has been none, a dollar is sufficient.</p>

<p>These figures are applicable in the cases
of unmarried women and bachelors, although
the tendency of the latter is to
give more. The sums named, however, are
regarded as acceptable by the servants
themselves. Naturally, they enjoy the
lavish, even prodigal tips given by certain
persons of wealth, who are more ostentatious
than discreet. Such indiscretions,
however, need not set up a false standard
for other guests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>In the case of a husband and wife, the
tips to maid and butler, etc., should be
increased. It is usual for the wife to tip
the female servants, while the husband
satisfies those of his own sex. When the
care of the guest’s shoes devolves on a
house-boy, he, too, should be remembered
with a half-dollar.</p>

<p>The male guests frequently give a tip
of a dollar or more to the cook.</p>

<p>It is the duty of the hostess in the case of
a woman visitor to bid her farewell in person,
even if this should necessitate arising
at an unpleasantly early hour. But in the
case of a man’s leaving thus early, it suffices
if she makes her farewell the night
before. It then becomes the duty of the
host to attend on the guest for the breakfast
and departure.</p>

<p>In about a week after such a visit, the
guest should write a note to the hostess,
expressing warm appreciation of the hospitality
thus enjoyed. It is also permissible
for the guest to send a gift that is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
too costly, such as a book, or any simple
thing that may serve as a token of remembrance.
But this is in no wise obligatory,
and, in fact, good taste is likely to prevent
the bestowal of such a gift in most cases.
There could hardly be anything less satisfactory
to a hostess than a string of such
souvenirs from her whilom guests.</p>

<p>Where the visit is a very short one, less
than two days, it is customary to dispense
with the bread-and-butter letter.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTIONS</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-s.jpg" width="133" height="140" alt="S" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">SIMPLICITY SHOULD always
characterize good
manners, and this truth
applies especially in the
matter of introductions.
There should be no attempt at fine
phrases.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Smith, let me present Mr. Jones.”</p>

<p>It is to be noted that the names of both
persons concerned are given. They should
be spoken with entire distinctness.</p>

<p>In this form, a man is presented to a
woman, and this is the rule to be generally
observed. It is admissible for the introduction
to contain an expression of the
man’s wish for it.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Smith, Mr. Jones desires to be
presented to you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>Slight variations in the phrasing of these
forms are permitted. For example, after
saying, “Mrs. Smith, let me present Mr.
Jones,” it is proper to add some such
phrase as, “He is very anxious to meet
you.”</p>

<p>It is always a mark of courtesy to request
a lady’s permission in advance of the actual
introduction. When introductions are to
be made between a woman, who is a newcomer,
and an assembly of guests, the newcomer
is given the formal distinction of
receiving the introductions.</p>

<p>“Miss Brown, let me present Mrs. Robinson,
Miss Robinson, Miss Helen Robinson,
Mr. Jones, Mr. Truesdale.”</p>

<p>Often, the form of introduction is curtailed,
especially when the company is
numerous. In such case, merely the names
are spoken, that of the stranger having first
place.</p>

<p>“Miss Brown—Mrs. Robinson, Miss
Robinson, Miss Helen Robinson, Mr. Jones,
Mr. Truesdale.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>Care must be taken to remember that the
person to whom the introduction is made
has the place of honor. It is on this account
that the rule of proper procedure requires
the presentation of a man to a
woman, and always the presentation of
the inferior to the superior, although the
distinction is usually purely theoretical.
For example, an unmarried woman should
be presented to a matron. So, the younger
person should be presented to his or her
elders; the ordinary person should be
presented to the person of distinction.
Where men or women are of nearly equal
age or station, it is safer not to discriminate
between them by presenting one to
the other. It is enough merely to name
them.</p>

<p>“Mr. Smith, Mr. Robinson.” Or: “Mrs.
Jones, Mrs. Brown.”</p>

<p>It is a part of good tact on the part of a
host or hostess in making introductions to
add a few words of explanation as to some
particular interest of each, which may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of assistance to them at the beginning of
their conversation.</p>

<p>In every instance, the greatest care
should be taken by the person making an
introduction to pronounce both names with
the utmost clearness. Nothing is more
annoying than an indistinct mumble that
leaves the hearers uninformed.</p>

<p>When, for any reason, one fails to
understand a stranger’s name at the
time of introduction, it is permissible to
ask it.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, but I did not understand
the name.”</p>

<p>There are some variations that should
be noted as to the manner of acknowledging
an introduction. In her own home, a
woman should offer her hand, while saying,
“Mrs. Smith, I am very glad to meet you,”
or any similar phrase of cordial greeting.
But such a cordial phrase is not to be used
by a woman when a man is presented to
her, unless she is the hostess. A man, on
the contrary, on receiving his introduction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
to a lady, should express his appreciation
in a courteous sentence.</p>

<p>“I am very glad to meet you, Miss
Robinson.”</p>

<p>The tendency to-day is toward elimination
of handshaking by women on the occasion
of an introduction, except in the case
of a hostess. A slight bow of the head,
a smile and the repetition of the stranger’s
name are deemed enough. But
many women still prefer a less formal
manner, and give their hand when an introduction
is made.</p>

<p>It is the duty of a hostess to stand up
when receiving an introduction. This applies
equally whether the stranger is a
man or a woman. But a woman other
than the hostess, when a member of a
group, remains seated during any introduction
to her unless it is of one her superior
in age or station, whom she should honor
by rising. Otherwise, it is preferable for
a woman to stand in acknowledging an
introduction of one of her own sex, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
she should remain seated when a man is
presented to her.</p>

<p>In England, it is usual to omit introductions
among those gathered in the same
house, and guests are expected to conduct
themselves as acquaintances without this
formality. In our country, however, the
custom has not prevailed to any considerable
extent, and it is not ordinarily proper
for strangers to address each other without
having been introduced, even though they
are fellow-guests.</p>

<p>A hostess should introduce all her guests
one to another at ordinary dinner-parties,
luncheons, or breakfasts. But, in the case
of very large dinner-parties, she is required
only to introduce those who are to be partners
at table, though it is advisable for her
to make other introductions to any extent
convenient. At the table, however, introductions
should be carefully avoided. If
the women leave the table before the men,
other introductions may be made among
them in the drawing-room. The men, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
on returning to the drawing-room may be
presented to such women as they have not
already met.</p>

<p>When a hostess receives at home, she
should introduce each new arrival to some
of the guests who are near by. If she has
an assistant in receiving, each guest should
be presented. On formal occasions, it is
not her duty to go about among the guests
in order to introduce them.</p>

<p>The hostess at a large ball follows a
similar course of conduct. But in less
formal affairs she should be at pains to
see that no guest is neglected, and that
each, as far as possible, has a due share
in the dancing.</p>

<p>It is especially desirable on all formal
occasions, such as large balls for example,
that a man wishing to present a friend to
a woman should first privately ask her
permission.</p>

<p>Introductions of a very casual sort should
never be taken too seriously. This applies
particularly to those made in a public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
place, such as the street, when a person
accompanied by a friend meets an acquaintance,
who is a stranger to that friend, and
there is a pause for a brief chat. Usually,
there is no occasion for an introduction
under these circumstances, and if one is
made it may be afterward ignored. As a
matter of fact, only a rather extensive conversation
between the acquaintances would
justify an introduction. Perfunctory introductions
of those temporarily associated
in a game on the tennis court, or the like,
are to be regarded as equally casual, and
not of a sort necessitating subsequent
recognition.</p>

<p>Introductions may be formally made by
letter. In such case, the letter should deal
exclusively with the introduction. There
is no set form, but the following will serve
as a sufficient guide, to be varied according
to personal inclination:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class="right">
<i>Burlington, Vermont.</i><br />
<span style="margin-right: 1em;"><i>June 1, 1919.</i></span><br />
</div>

<i>My dear Mrs. Smith:</i>

<p><i>It gives me great pleasure to introduce
to you my friend, Miss Truesdale,
who is about to visit relatives in your
city. I shall deeply appreciate any
courtesy you may show her.</i></p>

<p><i>With kindest regards to yourself
and Mr. Smith, I am,</i></p>

<div class="sig">
<i><span style="margin-right: 2em;">Yours sincerely,</span><br />
Mabel Potter</i><br />
</div></div>

<p>A similar form will suffice for the introduction
of a man, whether to another man
or to a woman. Discretion should be exercised
always in the granting of letters
of introduction, and it is well to write a
separate letter giving details concerning
the person thus introduced. The letter of
introduction itself should be placed in an
addressed envelope, which is left unsealed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
to be presented in person by the one to be
introduced.</p>

<p>Instead of a letter, a common practise
uses the visiting-card of the person making
the introduction. In such case, a line is
written across the top of the card.</p>

<div class="center"><i>Introducing Mr. Russell Elliot</i></div>

<p>This card also is enclosed within its
proper envelope, duly addressed, but unsealed,
and delivered to the person for
whose benefit it is given.</p>

<p>It is common for a man to call at the
residence of the person to whom the introduction
is addressed, and there give the
envelope, still unsealed, to the servant, together
with his own card. In the absence
of the host or hostess, the caller places his
own card inside the envelope, which is
then sealed, and left. A woman never
follows this procedure. She places her
card in the envelope containing the introduction,
which is then sealed, and dropped
in the post for delivery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>One receiving such a letter of introduction,
whether man or woman, is expected,
if the bearer is a woman, to call on her
within two days’ time, and to follow this
up with some sort of hospitable entertainment.
If, for any imperative reason, a
call is impossible, a letter should be written
in explanation.</p>

<p>The like procedure is followed when both
parties are men. But when a man presents
such a letter of introduction to a woman,
she does not, of course, call upon him, but
writes to extend her hospitable offers.</p>

<h2>LETTERS</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t2.jpg" width="130" height="140" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">THE MOST TROUBLESOME
detail in letter-writing
is the matter of address.
It should be noted that there
is a distinction between <i>Dear</i>
and <i>My dear</i>. In our country, the more formal
style is with the pronoun, while the pronoun
is omitted in writing to friends. A
letter to a mere acquaintance begins
with the words, <i>My dear</i> .............................
But the form for an intimate is simply
<i>Dear</i> .............................</p>

<p>The usual address for business purposes
and to those with whom no social relations
are established is <i>Dear Sir</i>. The plural
is used in addressing firms, <i>Dear Sirs</i>, or
the one word <i>Gentlemen</i>, may be employed.</p>

<p>In addressing a man with whom social
relations are established, the surname is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
used, preceded by <i>Dear</i> or <i>My dear</i>, according
to the degree of intimacy. <i>My dear
Mr. Hudson; Dear Mr. Grant.</i></p>

<p>A woman who is a stranger may be addressed
either as <i>Madam</i> or <i>Dear Madam</i>,
whether she be married or unmarried. The
form “<i>Dear Miss</i>” is to be avoided under all
circumstances.</p>

<p>For the woman with whom the writer is
formally acquainted, the address is: <i>My
dear Mrs.</i> .............................., if she is married,
and <i>My dear Miss</i> ............................, if she is
unmarried. When the person is a friend,
she should be addressed: <i>Dear Mrs.</i> ................,
if she is a married woman, and <i>Dear Miss</i>
............................, if she is unmarried.</p>

<p>The full name should be signed to formal
letters. The married woman should use
her own Christian name, not her husband’s
with the <i>Mrs.</i> prefixed. But, in business
communications to strangers, she may very
properly give her husband’s name with the
prefix <i>Mrs.</i>, below her usual signature, and
inclosed in parenthesis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Similarly, for the sake of clearness, a
business letter by an unmarried woman
may have <i>Miss</i> in parenthesis before the
name.</p>

<p>Envelopes should be addressed to the
recipient with the full name and necessary
prefix—-<i>Mr.</i>, <i>Mrs.</i>, or <i>Miss</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Mr.</i>, however, must be omitted if
<i>Esq.</i> is written after the name. The English
custom limits the use of Esquire to
those who are technically gentlemen. For
example, <i>Esq.</i> is placed after the name in
addressing a barrister, but it must not be
used in writing to a tradesman, who is
given only the prefix <i>Mr.</i></p>

<p>The prefix <i>Mr.</i> is used when Junior or
Senior is indicated after the name by an
abbreviation. In such case, <i>Esq.</i> must
never be written.</p>

<p>It must be noted also that in the case of
addresses, as with cards, to which attention
has already been given, the husband’s title
must not be given to the wife. <i>Mrs. Colonel</i>,
<i>Mrs. Doctor</i>, <i>Mrs. Professor</i>, and the like,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
are barbarisms, which are not tolerated in
America or England. The Germans, however,
use them.</p>

<p>The phrase before the signature to a
letter varies according to the circumstances,
and especially according to the individual
taste. Thus, in concluding a very formal
communication, it is quite proper to use
the old-fashioned wording, <i>I am, my dear
Madam, your obedient servant</i>. An ordinary
convenient form that covers a wide field
is, <i>I remain</i>, <i>Yours sincerely</i>, or <i>Yours
faithfully</i>, or <i>Yours cordially</i>, writing <i>I
remain</i> on one line, and the <i>Yours</i>, etc., on
the line below. Thus:</p>

<p class="center">
<i>I remain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Yours sincerely,</span></i><br />
</p>

<p><i>Yours truly</i>, or <i>Very truly yours</i>, is best
reserved for business communications.
<i>Yours respectfully</i> is applicable for business
communications, and also for letters addressed
to superiors, and for use generally
as a rather meaningless style.</p>

<p>Men of exalted position are commonly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
addressed as <i>Sir</i> without any qualifying
word. And the form in ending is, <i>I have,
Sir, the honor to remain Your most obedient
servant</i>—<i>Your</i>, etc., forming a separate
line.</p>

<p>A letter of a social sort would begin,
<i>My dear Mr. President</i>.</p>

<p>The like form would suffice for the vice-president,
except for a letter of social character,
when he should be addressed by
name, <i>My dear Mr. ........................</i>.</p>

<p>A justice of the supreme court, a senator,
a member of the house of representatives,
a cabinet officer, the governor of a state,
etc., all have the same formal <i>Sir</i> as the
address and the corresponding phrase in
conclusion. But there is variation in the
address when the letter is of social import.
The justice may be addressed <i>My dear Justice
.................</i>, or <i>Dear Mr. Justice
.................</i>.</p>

<p>The senator is addressed <i>My dear Senator
.......................</i>. The representative in
congress is addressed <i>My dear Mr. ................</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>On the envelope, the forms are respectively
<i>Mr. Justice ...................</i>, <i>Senator
.......................</i>, <i>Hon. ..............</i> (for the
congressman).</p>

<p>The social letter to a cabinet officer addresses
him by name, <i>My dear .................</i>,
and has on the envelope <i>Hon.</i> preceding the
name and his official designation following
it.</p>

<p>A governor is usually addressed <i>My dear
Governor .......................</i>. And the envelope
should have the title preceding the name.</p>

<p>In all cases except that of the President,
the conclusion of a social letter is a simple
form such as, <i>I remain, Yours very sincerely</i>.</p>

<p>A mayor is addressed either as <i>Sir</i>, or
<i>Your Honor</i>, in formal communications,
and as <i>My dear Mayor .................</i> in
social correspondence. The envelope properly
gives him a full designation, <i>His Honor
the Mayor of ....................</i>. The name
follows, written on a lower line.</p>

<p>The form of address is the same for both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
official and social letters in the case of a
Roman Catholic archbishop: <i>Most Reverend
and Dear Sir</i>. The conclusion should
run: <i>I have the honor to remain Your obedient
servant</i>—<i>Your</i>, etc., being written on
a lower line. The envelope carries <i>The
Most Reverend ......................., Archbishop of
..................</i>.</p>

<p>All letters to a cardinal begin <i>Your Eminence</i>.
The conclusion is the same as to
an archbishop. The envelope reads <i>His
Eminence Cardinal ........................</i>.</p>

<p>For a Roman Catholic bishop all letters
begin <i>Right Reverend and Dear Sir</i>. The
conclusion is that used for the preceding
prelates. On the envelope: <i>The Right
Reverend .................., Bishop of ...........</i>.</p>

<p>A Protestant bishop, also, is addressed
<i>Right Reverend and Dear Sir</i> officially, but
a social letter begins <i>My dear Bishop
....................</i>. The conclusion may take
the form given for Roman Catholic dignitaries,
but for social letters it is sufficient
to write, <i>I remain Yours sincerely</i>. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
envelope reads: <i>The Right Reverend ................,
Bishop of ............................</i>.</p>

<p>Both priests and Protestant clergymen
are officially addressed: <i>Reverend and Dear
Sir</i>. But, in a social letter, the beginning
is <i>Dear Father ..................</i>, in the case of
a priest; while the Protestant minister is
addressed as <i>Dear Mr. ........................</i>, or
<i>Dear Doctor ....................</i>, if he has such a
title. The conclusion for either need be
no more than: <i>I remain, Yours very sincerely</i>.
The envelope bears, <i>The Reverend
......................</i>.</p>

<p>The possession of degrees may be indicated
by writing the proper initials after
the name. Where the clergyman has the
degree of Doctor, this is sometimes used as
an abbreviation preceding the name—<i>The
Reverend Dr. .........................</i>.</p>

<h2>LUNCHEONS</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t3.jpg" width="131" height="138" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">THE ETIQUETTE for a
luncheon is essentially the
same as that for a breakfast,
which has already been described.
But the luncheon
at present enjoys a popularity that is distinctive
in one respect: it serves conveniently
very often as a function wholly for
the entertainment of feminine guests.</p>

<p>The usual hour for a luncheon is from
one to two o’clock. The invitations, unless
the affair is to be quite informal, should
be sent out ten days before the date set.
As in the case of a breakfast, the invitation
may be sent on a visiting-card, writing
below the name:</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Luncheon at one o’clock<br />
April the fourth</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>For an especially formal affair, the invitation
should be engraved on square
white cards of large size, similar to those
employed for dinner-invitations.</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Mrs. George Vinton Thorne<br />
<br />

<br />
........................................<br />
<br />
company at luncheon<br />
<br />
on ..............................<br />
<br />
at .......................... o’clock<br />
<br />
Eleven Green Street</i><br />
</p>

<p>A note written in the first person may
convey the invitation, if the hostess prefers
this manner.</p>

<p>The acceptance or refusal of an invitation
may be in the third person, following
the examples given in the chapter on dinners,
or it may be written as a note in the
first person. In either case, the method
used in the invitation itself must govern
the style of the reply.</p>

<p>At the more formal luncheon, the menu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
may be elaborate, with oysters, bouillon,
fish, and other courses following to any
desired extent, but care must be taken
always that the general character of the
viands served must not be oversubstantial.
The meal should be of a distinctively lighter
sort as compared with dinner.</p>

<p>The women guests usually wear their
most effective frocks. Wraps are left in
the cloak-room provided, or, if this is lacking,
in the hall. The hats are not removed,
but the veil is either pushed up out of the
way, or removed, according to the wearer’s
pleasure. The gloves are taken off after
arrival at table, and left in the lap, covered
by the napkin.</p>

<p>A guest should remain for at least half
an hour after the completion of the meal,
and from this minimum of time up to an
hour or perhaps a little longer, according
to the particular circumstances.</p>

<p>The farewell of each guest should, of
course, contain some phrase expressing appreciation
of the hospitality enjoyed.</p>

<h2>MOURNING</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t4.jpg" width="130" height="138" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">THERE IS ROOM for so
much variety in the expression
of personal tastes as
to the matter of mourning
that hard-and-fast rules are
of doubtful value. There is, however, some
degree of exactness as to the dress suitable
for widows, although, even in this connection,
individual choice and the changes of
fashion exert their influence to the display
of differing modes.</p>

<p>The widow’s mourning may be divided
into three periods, termed respectively first,
second and third.</p>

<p>The first mourning includes the entire
costume in black. Usually, the material
of the dress is of worsted, with a trimming
of crêpe. The black bonnet is of crêpe,
and from it hangs a long veil, also of crêpe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Formerly, these veils were of extreme
length, reaching even to the hem of the
gown. The tendency has been, however,
toward shortening the veil, and the present
fashion insists on only a moderate length.
Another veil, worn over the face, was formerly
both long and heavy, but the style
has been modified, and at present it is of
lighter texture and of much briefer proportions.
The bonnet has white ruching
within the front edge, and the gown is
trimmed with sheer white cuffs, and a collar
of the same material.</p>

<p>The gloves must be of dull black, and
ornaments of dull jet, with a black-bordered
handkerchief.</p>

<p>This first mourning should be worn for a
full year. A change may then be made to
second mourning, in which the dress may
be of crêpe de chine or dull silk, with a hat
carrying black chiffon, etc., and ornaments
of dull jet.</p>

<p>The third mourning is assumed after
another six months. In this white and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
lilac are permitted to relieve the somberness
of the attire. This mourning is worn
for a period of six months, also, after which
colors may be resumed.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the white ruche
on the bonnet is the one distinctive feature
of the first mourning that designates
the wearer as a widow. A woman may
wear exactly the same costume, with the
exception of this white ruche on the bonnet,
in the mourning for a parent, a child, a
brother or a sister.</p>

<p>The period for wearing mourning in such
case, and the changes in it, may follow the
details given above for widows.</p>

<p>Mourning for a parent-in-law is black,
with the crêpe omitted. This is worn for
only a month, and is followed by any preferred
combinations of black and white, relieved
by lilac, for a fortnight or a little
longer.</p>

<p>The mourning for close relatives worn
by a young unmarried woman does not
include the bonnet and veil. Instead, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
hat trimmed with crêpe is worn, and a
black net veil over the face is trimmed
with crêpe. After six months or a year,
the crêpe is omitted from hat and veil, and
also from the gown. Black and white and
lilac are then deemed suitable. Usually,
however, the older unmarried women wear
the veil and bonnet of the first mourning,
as do widows, but with the white ruche
omitted.</p>

<p>Mourning is not usually adopted when
the death is of relatives-in-law or of a
grandparent.</p>

<p>Three months is ordinarily sufficient for
mourning in the case of an uncle or aunt,
and it does not include crêpe. Ornaments
may be worn, though preferably of a very
quiet sort.</p>

<p>In general, it is well to bear in mind
that mourning should not be worn except
for the members of one’s immediate family.
Of course, the particular circumstances in
each case must be a determining factor.
For example, while mourning is not customarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
worn for a cousin, yet a girl who
had made a home with such a relative
might appropriately wear mourning as for
her own mother.</p>

<p>Crêpe is not deemed suitable for girls
not yet old enough for a formal entrance
into society, and children should be spared
the lugubrious trappings of woe in every
case. But a girl about sixteen years of age,
on the death of a member of the family,
appropriately wears a black dress, relieved
only by touches of white, and a black hat,
with dull black ribbons. She should leave
off jewelry, but she should not carry a
handkerchief with black border.</p>

<p>The mourning for a widower is often
divided into two periods. During the first,
black is worn throughout in the costume,
with white linen. The hat-band is of crêpe.
The present tendency is to make this band
much narrower than it was of yore. It is
left off altogether after a year, or perhaps
eight months, as the second mourning
begins. The second mourning permits the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
use of gray and white in the costume. A
man’s mourning for a child, parent, brother
or sister may continue for a full year, or it
may be put off after six months according
to his choice. The mourning includes a
hat-band of crêpe. If a man wishes to
wear mourning for a more distant relative,
he may use the black and white and gray
of the widower’s second period, but men
ordinarily do not assume mourning for any
except closest relations.</p>

<p>A mourning band on the sleeve is sometimes
worn by men, but it is impossible to
describe its significance from the standpoint
of propriety, since it is worn equally
for those most closely related and for those
most distantly, without distinction, and
since it is a custom derived originally from
England, where it serves as a cheap method
of providing mourning liveries for servants.</p>

<p>After the loss of a close relation, a woman
pays no calls for six months. After that
time, she may visit her intimates, but not
on their at-home days. She may also attend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
concerts and theater matinées and the like,
in a very quiet way. After a year, she
may appear at small dinners, and at the
theater in the evening, and the like. But
box parties and all the elaborate functions,
such for example as balls, must not be
resumed until the period of mourning has
expired.</p>

<p>Elderly women are likely to prefer a
mourning garb for the remainder of their
lifetime, after the death of a husband. In
such cases, after perhaps two years, the
widow’s bonnet and veil are given up, and
nun’s veiling is substituted. While the
gown remains black, the crêpe is omitted
from it, and the mourning handkerchief is
no longer carried. Jewelry is worn, but not
of an ostentatious kind.</p>

<h2>MUSICALES</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t5.jpg" width="134" height="139" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">THE MUSICALE is merely
a formal at home where
music is made a special
feature of the entertainment.
Throughout, the
procedure is that of an at home, and the
details are to be found in full in the
chapter under that heading. The only
formal difference is in the wording of the
invitation, which makes mention of music
as the feature.</p>

<p>The invitations are engraved, and may
take either of the two usual forms, according
to the choice of the hostess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">

<br />

<br />

</p>

<p>Or the at-home form may be used as
follows:</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Mr. and Mrs. George H. Baxter<br />
<br />

<br />
Friday evening, May first<br />
<br />
at half-past nine o’clock<br />
<br />
Twenty-seven Maple Street<br />
<br />
Music</i><br />
</p>

<p>Such an affair in the evening is often of
the most elaborate character, and is essentially
a concert. But a musicale may be
given with equal propriety in the afternoon.
The form for engraved invitations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
is precisely the same, with the single exception
of the hours named, for the afternoon
entertainment specifies the time as <i>from
four until seven o’clock</i>.</p>

<p>For a less formal occasion, a hostess may
extend her invitations by sending a visiting-card,
on which she writes, below her name,
<i>Friday, May first, four to seven o’clock</i>, and
underneath this the single word <i>Music</i>.
Or in place of the word <i>Music</i>, she may
write <i>To hear</i> .............. adding the name
of a particular performer.</p>

<p>The obligations of the guests follow in
all respects those to which attention has
been already given under the title “At
Homes.” Thus, in the matter of costumes,
the usage resembles that explained concerning
correct garb for both afternoon
and evening receptions in the earlier
chapter.</p>

<p>It might be well to emphasize the fact
that no direct reply is required for an invitation
announcing that the hostess will be
at home on a certain date. But the case is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
quite otherwise when that form of invitation
is employed which requests the pleasure
of the guest’s company. This demands
a prompt answer, whether of acceptance or
of refusal, which should be couched in the
third person. Thus:</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Henry Sage Beckett<br />
<br />
accept with pleasure<br />
<br />
Mrs. Baxter’s kind invitation<br />
<br />
for May first<br />
<br />
Nineteen Wentworth Square<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">April twenty-first, 1919</span></i><br />
</p>

<p>Or, in the event of inability to accept, or
disinclination, the answer should run as
follows:</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Henry Sage Beckett<br />
<br />
regret that a previous engagement<br />
<br />
prevents their acceptance<br />
<br />
of Mrs. Baxter’s kind invitation<br />
<br />

<h2>OPERA</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="136" height="141" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">A &nbsp; SUFFICIENT FORM for
an invitation to an opera
party will be found in the
chapter on the theater,
which needs only a verbal
change to specify the particular performance
at the opera instead of at the playhouse.
In general, also, the procedure
suited to attendance at the theater is to
be followed in connection with the opera.
But there are certain differences that
should be regarded.</p>

<p>The dress for the opera is more formal
than for the theater, generally speaking.
The man, for example, usually keeps his
white gloves on. The woman, for her part,
wears a gown that is sleeveless and decolleté,
and displays jewels according to her
means or taste. An aigrette takes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
place of the hat that may be worn to the
theater. Nevertheless, it is quite permissible
for a woman occupying a stall in the
orchestra at the opera to wear a costume
of the sort commonly seen at the theater.</p>

<p>Visiting at the opera is a distinctive
feature, facilitated as it is by the number
of boxes, so greatly in excess of those with
which the theater is supplied. For it is
with the boxes that this visiting is chiefly
concerned, though it reaches to some extent
to the orchestra stalls.</p>

<p>Between acts is the proper time for such
calls, which are usually, but not exclusively,
paid by men. A gentleman may
call on a lady of his acquaintance in a box,
though she is a guest of a host or hostess
who is not known to him. In such case,
the woman to whom he pays the visit must
introduce him to her entertainer. But an
introduction of the sort is merely formal,
and entails no necessity of subsequent
recognition by either party.</p>

<p>No more than five minutes, or even less,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
should be given to such calls, but some discretion
is permitted by the particular circumstances.
Thus, where there are many
coming and going, the time should be
shorter than when there are few other
visitors, or none. The call should never
extend beyond the end of the intermission.</p>

<p>Since an opera box is equipped with a
vestibule of its own, the women do not
leave their wraps in the cloak-room, but
wait until their arrival at the box, when
they are taken off in the vestibule. Afterward,
on entering the box, the chaperon
and other older women precede the younger,
and are offered the choice of seats. But
they usually prefer the less conspicuous
positions, and the chairs at the rail are
given to the débutantes, or younger matrons.
The exact arrangement is always a
matter for the display of tact on the part
of host or hostess.</p>

<p>Visiting among the stalls is necessarily
more limited, but is practised to any extent
rendered convenient by location.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>In such visiting, the ordinary amenities
of social intercourse are to be observed.
The men, for example, must stand when a
lady enters the box in which they are seated,
and they should remain standing until her
departure, or until she has taken a chair.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-capi">PRIVATE THEATRICALS
are usually the feature of an
evening function.</p>

<p>The form of invitation is
exactly the same as for a
musicale, with the one exception in substituting
<i>Theatricals at ten o’clock</i>. The
phrase appears thus in the at-home form
of announcement. When the invitation
requests the pleasure of the guest’s company,
<i>At Private Theatricals</i> is preferred
as the descriptive statement.</p>

<p>On occasions when the theatricals are
to be followed by a dance, the word <i>Dancing</i>
is added at the bottom of the card.</p>

<p>The letters <i>R.s.v.p.</i> are commonly employed
in connection with such invitations,
and their appearance on the card emphasizes
the necessity of a written reply.</p>

the man’s proper position is
usually on the side toward
the curb, and he maintains
this place also when walking with two
women. He should never station himself
between them, unless under the informal
circumstances of a country road, or the like.</p>

<p>In the day time, a man does not offer a
woman his arm when they walk together,
though of course he should give her the
support of his hand under her elbow when
such assistance is obviously required, as
in mounting the steps of a car. But in the
evening a man properly offers his arm to a
woman when they are to walk together,
and she lays her hand on his forearm.
They should never hook arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>When a man and woman who are acquainted
with each other meet in the
street, it is the woman’s place to extend
recognition by a nod and smile, which
latter varies from coldness to warmth
according to her will. On receiving such
recognition, for which in any formal acquaintance
he must wait, the man raises
his hat, and at the same time bows.</p>

<p>When a man is walking with a woman,
he must salute in the same fashion any
others that pass who recognize either himself
or his companion, except that where
the person is not an acquaintance of his
own, he merely lifts his hat without bowing.</p>

<p>When a man encounters a woman on the
street, and wishes to talk with her, he
should not detain her, but with her permission
should turn and walk beside her.
The woman, however, is privileged thus to
retain the man in conversation, but she
should withdraw to one side, out of the
way of passers-by.</p>

<p>In escorting a woman in a car, the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
should assist her to enter, and then follow.
But in leaving, he precedes her and descends
first, then turning to help her down.</p>

<p>Good sense must determine the precise
conduct for propriety in various circumstances.
Ordinarily, where a couple cannot
well walk side by side, the man follows
behind the woman. But where the way
is difficult for any reason, he goes in advance—as,
for example, when it becomes
necessary to force the way through a
crowd.</p>

<p>Some men make a point of standing uncovered
throughout the length of any conversation
with a woman in the street.
This mode is not to be encouraged, especially
in the inclement northern winter.
Merely raising the hat at meeting and
again at parting is quite sufficient.</p>

<h2>TABLE MANNERS</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-d.jpg" width="127" height="131" alt="D" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">DEPORTMENT AT TABLE
is the most important single
item in the total of good
manners. Yet, the requirements
are very simple—so
simple indeed that there is little excuse
for those who fail in them.</p>

<p>It should hardly be necessary to say
that the position must be one of well-balanced
erectness. A man’s hands should
be kept in his lap when not busy. So of
a woman’s—formerly. Of recent years,
a new custom has crept in, and it is common
to see a woman’s forearm or elbow
resting at ease on the table.</p>

<p>The napkin is only partly unfolded, and
laid across the lap. In the case of a woman,
it covers her gloves, which she has taken
off on seating herself. At the end of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
meal, the crumpled napkin is laid beside
the plate. But, when making an extended
stay with friends, the napkin is folded if
the host and hostess fold theirs in preparation
for use at another meal.</p>

<p>The knife is employed only for cutting
purposes, being then held in the right hand.
It is afterward put down, while the fork
is transferred to the right hand for passing
food to the mouth. When not in use both
knife and fork are left on the plate. They
should not be held in the hands, or laid
down on the table. They are to remain
on the plate also if it is sent for another
helping. When eating is ended, knife and
fork are laid together on the plate—parallel,
points to the center, and the fork tines
down.</p>

<p>The fork should be used throughout
with the tines downward. It is only used
spoon-fashion for small vegetables such as
peas. The fork rather than a spoon should
be used for eating ices, melons, and the
like. It is used to fold lettuce and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
salad leaves, which must not be cut with
a knife.</p>

<p>The knife is used only for cutting, and
is afterward laid down on the plate.</p>

<p>Beverages in glasses or cups are tested
by sipping from a spoon, which is then
laid down. Afterward one drinks directly
from the container. The spoon must never
be allowed to stand in a cup or glass. For
taking soup, the spoon is pushed forward,
not drawn toward one. The soup plate is
never tipped. The liquid must be taken
into the mouth from the side of the spoon
never from the end.</p>

<p>Boiled eggs are properly eaten with a
spoon, of course, as are jellies, custards
and the like, grape-fruit and various fruits
served with cream, and cereals.</p>

<p>A finger-bowl is properly used on finishing
a fruit course. A slight rinsing of the
finger-tips suffices, after which they are
wiped on the napkin.</p>

<p>Butter is not served at formal dinners.</p>

<p>At all other meals a special plate is laid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
for bread and butter, and a small knife
of silver for spreading the butter. The
bread is broken with the fingers, a mouthful
at a time and separately buttered.
Cake is eaten either in the fingers or with
a fork.</p>

<p>Cheese is cut into small pieces. Each
piece is placed on a mouthful of bread or
cracker, and then eaten from the fingers.</p>

<p>Apples, pears, etc., are quartered, peeled,
cut in mouthfuls, and then eaten from
the fingers. Smaller fruits with pits are
eaten from the fingers. Each pit is taken
from the mouth in the closed hand and deposited
on the plate.</p>

<p>Asparagus is eaten with a fork. That
part of the stalk not easily cut by the fork
is left. But burr artichokes are eaten from
the fingers a leaf at a time, after it has
been dipped in the sauce. Only the heart
demands the use of a fork.</p>

<p>Celery, olives and radishes are eaten
from the fingers. So, also, are crystallized
fruits, almonds and other nuts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>When leaving the table at the conclusion
of a meal elsewhere than in one’s own
house, the chair is left without being
pushed back close to the table.</p>

<h2>TEAS</h2>

</div>

<p class="drop-capi">IN THE COUNTRY, where
the dinner is in the middle
of the day, the evening meal
is called either supper or
tea, and an invitation to tea
ordinarily means an invitation to the evening
meal. In England, where afternoon
tea-serving is universal among all classes,
the evening meal is frequently designated
high tea.</p>

<p>The proprieties concerning afternoon tea
are explained in the chapter entitled, “At

<h2>THEATER-PARTIES</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-w3.jpg" width="125" height="126" alt="W" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">WHEN A THEATER-PARTY
is to be given, it is not customary
to use the engraved
form of invitations, but notes
written in the first person
suffice.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<i>97 Hamilton Street,<br />
<span style="margin-right: 1em;">May 1, 1919</span></i><br />
</p>

<i>My dear Miss Hammer:</i>

<p><i>Will you give me the pleasure of
dining with me on Wednesday evening
of next week, at seven o’clock, and of
afterward witnessing the new play at
the Brooke Theater?</i></p>

<p><i>In the hope that you are free that
evening and kindly disposed toward my
invitation, I remain,</i></p>

<p class="sig">
<i><span style="margin-right: 2em;">Yours sincerely,</span><br />
Mary Holmes</i><br />
</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>To such an invitation, the guest should
return an immediate reply, either of acceptance
or rejection, written in the first person,
after the manner of the other missive.</p>

<p>It is within the discretion of the host or
hostess to secure orchestra seats, or a box.
Care should be taken, in the case of a box,
not to have a sufficient number of guests
to cause crowding. The invitations should
be sent out about a week before the evening
of the party, but a longer or shorter
notice is permissible. A bachelor may find
it more convenient to give his invitations
in person, orally, and such laxity is allowable
on his part.</p>

<p>The giver of the entertainment may use
his or her discretion in having attendance
on the play preceded by an early dinner-party,
which may include all or only a part
of his guests; or having it followed by a
supper-party. Or the theater alone may
be deemed a sufficient entertainment.</p>

<p>Very often, a host orders an omnibus to
collect his guests for a theater-party and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
to carry them to the theater, and back
home after the performance. If this is
done, the invitation should specify the
fact, and notify the guest of the exact
time of the omnibus’s arrival.</p>

<p>When a man invites an unmarried woman
to be his companion at the theater, he is
expected also to invite another woman,
either a relation or friend, according to
circumstances, who shall act as chaperon.
But this rule is not too strictly enforced
where a friendship exists between a man
and a spinster of mature age.</p>

<p>It is the duty of the man to call in person
for his guests, and to provide them
with fitting transportation to and from the
theater. On their arrival at the theater, if
the women leave their wraps in the cloak-room,
he also should check his hat and
coat. He allows the ladies to precede him,
and inside the theater secures programs
for them, and then gives his checks to the
usher. The usher now leads the way, with
the ladies following and the host bringing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
up the rear. If he has retained his coat
and hat, he places his hat under the seat
and lays the folded coat over the back of
the chair or holds it across his knees. He
is careful always to retain the checks during
the evening since lack of them might
prove embarrassing if any error has been
made in the seating arrangements, as
sometimes happens.</p>

<p>A man thus escorting ladies to the theater
properly remains with them throughout
the performance. The only justifiable excuse
for leaving them for a few minutes is
when he occupies an aisle seat, and then
only when during an intermission a friend
comes to pay his respects, who can take
his place until the rising of the curtain.</p>

<p>The man wears evening dress for the
theater. He should by no means appear
in a tailless coat when acting as an escort
for ladies, or when a guest in a party that
includes ladies. He is permitted, however,
to remove his gloves on arrival at the theater.
The silk hat is often inconvenient for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
theater purposes, and for that reason the
crush hat has been preferred. But this
folding form of headgear has lost its vogue
to a great extent, and there is a growing
tendency toward the use of a black soft hat
for such evening wear.</p>

<p>The more usual form of woman’s dress is
not the decolleté of the ball-gown, but a
less extreme style, with sleeves. It is, of
course, of such elegance as to suit the
occasion. But the low-neck and sleeveless
gown is frequently to be seen, more especially
in the boxes.</p>

<p>With the less formal costume, a hat is
worn. This and the veil may be removed
in the cloak-room, or, if the wrap is retained,
it may be kept on until the seat is
reached. The outer garment is then folded
and laid over the back of the chair. After
having seated herself, the woman then unpins
her veil and removes it, together with
the hat, and these are afterward held in
the lap.</p>

<p>If the arrival at the theater is a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
late, and the wraps are not left in the
cloak-room, it is the part of good taste to
remove them before passing down the aisle
to the seats. Otherwise, their removal becomes
an unpleasant interruption to those
seated near by.</p>

<p>This same matter of consideration for
the rights of others is the reason why it is
necessary that the hats should be removed,
since it would shut off the view of the stage
from those seated behind. It should be
borne in mind always, also, that this consideration
for others should extend to the
matter of conversation during the performance,
which must be rigidly suppressed.
Care ought to be taken in every respect lest
there be an impolite intrusion on the rights
of others.</p>

<p>If there is supper in a restaurant after
the play, the wraps should be left in the
cloak-room as a rule, but a woman may
retain one of a sort that is not cumbersome,
according to her pleasure. The hat is not
removed for the meal. The veil may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
either be pushed up or taken off according
to the individual preference. The gloves
are removed after the party is seated at
table, and kept in the lap under the napkin
until the conclusion of the meal. They are
put on again before leaving the table.</p>

<h2>WEDDINGS</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t2.jpg" width="130" height="140" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">THE WEDDING-INVITATIONS
are sent out fully
two weeks before the marriage,
at least, and they
may be sent earlier, up to
a limit of two months.</p>

<p>The invitation is engraved on white
paper, of which there is a double sheet.
The invitation itself must occupy only the
first page. An average size is between
seven and eight inches in length and about
an inch less in width. Script is usually
preferred. The invitation is folded once
and placed in an unsealed envelope with
the guest’s name written on it. Another
envelope is used to contain this, on which
are written both the name and address,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
and it is sealed for delivery by post or
messenger.</p>

<p>It should be borne in mind that, while
husband and wife are joined in a single
invitation, other members of the family
must be separately invited, except that
more than one daughter may be included
under the designation <i>The Misses ....................</i>,
and similarly more than one son, <i>The
Messrs. ....................</i>. Otherwise, a daughter
receives an individual invitation, as
does also a son.</p>

<p>In cities, on the occasion of church weddings
where strangers often intrude, it is
common to inclose with the invitation a
small card inscribed:</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Please present this card at<br />
<br />
the Church of the Incarnation<br />
<br />
on Tuesday, June the first</i><br />
</p>

<p>A standard form for the wording of the
invitation is as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Henry L. Hudson<br />
<br />
request the honor of your presence<br />
<br />
at the marriage of their daughter<br />
<br />
Harriet<br />
<br />
to<br />
<br />
Mr. James Meade Trowbridge<br />
<br />
on Tuesday afternoon, June the first<br />
<br />
at half-past three o’clock<br />
<br />
The Church of the Incarnation<br />
<br />
Baltimore</i><br />
</p>

<p>The invitations are issued in the names
of the bride’s parents, or, lacking them,
in the name of her nearest relative, unless
this should be an unmarried sister. When
the invitations are issued by a brother,
his name only may be used, even though
he is married. But where the relation is a
married woman, the name of the husband
also appears on the invitations. Such invitations
issued by some one other than the
parents follow the form given above exactly,
save that the full name of the bride must
be given instead of her Christian name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
alone, and, of course, the proper relationship
must be indicated by a word substituted
for <i>daughter</i>.</p>

<p>It is usual, when the bride is a step-daughter,
to specify the relationship in
the invitation. Thus, in the form given
above, if Harriet were the daughter of Mrs.
Hudson by a previous marriage, the phrase
would run, <i>at the marriage of Mrs. Hudson’s
daughter, Harriet Blake Rothwell</i>. If she
were the daughter of Mr. Hudson, the
phrase would be, <i>at the marriage of Mr.
Hudson’s daughter, Harriet</i>.</p>

<p>The invitations to either a wedding-breakfast
or reception is inclosed with the
invitation to the ceremony, but the engraved
card is of the ordinary size.</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Henry L. Hudson<br />
<br />

<br />
Thirty-six Fremont Avenue</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>But often the name is omitted, and the
invitation may read simply:</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Reception<br />
<br />
From four o’clock<br />
<br />
Thirty-six Fremont Avenue</i><br />
</p>

<p>The initials <i>R.s.v.p.</i> may be used in the
lower left-hand corner of either form.</p>

<p>The only essential difference in the form
of the invitation to a home-wedding is that
instead of asking for the <i>honor of your
presence</i>, the request is for the <i>pleasure of
your company</i>. Of course, the home-address
must be given at the end, instead of the
name of the church. When the ceremony
is to be performed in the presence of only
a limited number of friends, those who are
to witness it receive with their invitation
a small engraved card, inscribed <i>Ceremony
at three o’clock</i>, or whatever the hour may
be.</p>

<p>Announcement-cards, following the celebration
of a quiet wedding, are sent out
on the day of the marriage. The paper
used is the same as that for the invitations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">

</p>

<p>A combination-card of bride and groom,
with their address, and perhaps her at-home
day, may be inclosed with the announcement.</p>

<p>If, for any reason, the announcement-cards
are not issued by the bride’s relatives,
they may be sent out by the engaged pair,
using the bride’s maiden name</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Mr. George Hart Bagot<br />

<br />
Albany</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>Unless the invitation to a wedding carries
the letters <i>R.s.v.p.</i>, it does not require
any reply, but an invitation to the reception
or breakfast should be acknowledged
by two visiting-cards, sent to the bride’s
parents, when attendance is not possible
or convenient. An acceptance or declination
is written in the third person, and follows
the corresponding form in reference
to a dinner-invitation, with the necessary
verbal change, substituting, <i>wedding-reception
of their daughter</i>, for <i>dinner</i>.</p>

<p>No acknowledgment is required for announcement-cards;
but it is well to call
on, or leave cards for, the bride’s parents.</p>

<p>It is impossible to state exactly all the
details in connection with the marriage-ceremony,
since the variations in personal
taste and circumstances are such that the
wedding may be fittingly celebrated in
almost regal state, with a dozen bridesmaids
and everything else with like profusion,
or the rite may be carried out with
a plainness and simplicity that yet perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
yields a significance more touching
than that of the gorgeous spectacle. Each
circle in every community has its own
accepted traditions, and it is always better
that these should be followed. The vagaries
of fashion may often tempt its votaries
to extravagances in following the
fads and fancies of the moment. But there
should be no frivolous tampering with the
marriage rite, which is proclaimed as a
sacrament by the church, and should be
always esteemed as the most sacred act
in the lives of those who thus make their
covenants together.</p>

<p>It need only be added that for an evening
wedding the bridegroom wears the regulation
evening clothes, while for an hour
earlier in the day his costume includes a
frock-coat of black or dark blue, a black
or white waistcoat, and striped trousers of
a lighter shade than the coat. The scarf
should be a white ascot, caught with a
pearl pin.</p>

<p>He wears patent-leather shoes and gray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
suède gloves. A silk hat forms the headgear
to accompany either the evening
dress or the other.</p>

<p>A maiden bride should wear white and
a veil of tulle with orange blossoms. The
gown may be decolleté and sleeveless for
an evening wedding. A woman who has
been married before may wear any color
pleasing to her, but not white, and she
must not veil herself, nor display the
orange blossoms. A train properly distinguishes
the wedding-gown.</p>

<p>On receipt of an invitation to a wedding,
any gift should be sent to the bride without
delay. There is no obligation on the part
of a merely formal acquaintance to send
a gift when invited to a church wedding,
but it is permissible. Such an obligation
exists for one invited to the breakfast or
reception, as well as one to be among a
limited number present at the actual marriage
on the occasion of a home wedding.
Sometimes, those invited to a church wedding
compromise by sending flowers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>The distinction between the maiden and
the matron is again emphasized in the
matter of the bouquet carried by the
bride, which for the maiden should be of
white flowers, such as lilies of the valley,
while for the woman it must be at least
touched with color—perhaps of orchids.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE is no royal road to learning.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IT is an old saying, and a true one, in a sense:
for prince and peasant must alike travel
the path.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">YET, there are many paths, and great differences
among them, as they lead to the
temple of knowledge. In some, the going is easy:
in some, hard. In some, the journeying is
pleasant and profitable: in some, toilsome—a
weary scramble over many stumbling blocks.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE builder of the road is the teacher. It
is his task to smooth the way, and to
make it straight: or to leave it all cluttered,
a twisted, haphazard course, that runs roughly
and reaches nowhere.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the “Made Easy” Series, it has been the
publisher’s purpose to provide for the
student the best possible road to learning—a

a learning made easy, yet none the less exact,

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
